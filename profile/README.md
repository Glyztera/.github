## **Glyztera: Primary Objectives Documentation**

### **Vision**

**An Accessible Universe of Transactions**: Glyztera aspires to be an effortless cryptocurrency that seamlessly integrates into the lives of individuals across Earth and potentially extends its reach to other planets. We envision a future where distance and technological barriers are a thing of the past, and Glyztera is at the forefront of interstellar commerce.

### **Mission**

**Empowering Everyone Through Efficient Cryptocurrency**: Our mission is to democratize the cryptocurrency sphere by introducing a low-power Proof of Work (PoW) coin. Glyztera is tailored to serve a broad spectrum of miners â€“ from individual enthusiasts to expansive corporations. Our commitment is twofold:

1. **Profitability for All**: By optimizing energy consumption, we ensure that every miner, irrespective of scale, stands to benefit.

2. **Rapid Transactions with Compact Footprint**: Glyztera is designed to support swift transactions, ensuring timely commerce. In tandem, our focus on maintaining a concise blockchain guarantees a hassle-free setup for nodes, promoting decentralization and ease of access.

### **Core Objectives**

1. **Low Power Mining**: Leveraging energy-efficient algorithms to ensure environmentally-friendly mining that's economically viable for all scales of miners.

2. **Intergalactic Potential**: Architecting the blockchain and protocols with the foresight of supporting transactions across vast interstellar distances.

3. **Optimized Transaction Speed**: Ensuring quick and seamless transactions by focusing on minimalistic block sizes and efficient consensus mechanisms.

4. **Development in Python**: Harnessing the versatility and accessibility of Python for the primary development, ensuring a wide base of potential contributors.

5. **US Launch with Global Aspirations**: Initiating our journey from the US, with the vision of capturing the global market as Glyztera's value proposition resonates worldwide.

6. **Active Community Engagement**: Regular updates, transparent communication, and an open-door policy for feedback via platforms like GitHub.

### **Potential Applications for Intergalactic Transactions**

As we venture into the realm of space exploration and colonization, our needs for a secure, fast, and efficient means of intergalactic transactions become paramount. Glyztera, with its innovative blockchain architecture, is poised to serve these needs. Here are potential scenarios and applications where Glyztera's intergalactic capabilities shine:

1. **Interstellar Trade**: As humanity establishes colonies on other planets or even star systems, there will be a necessity for trade. Resources available on one planet might be scarce on another. Glyztera can facilitate instant trade settlements across vast cosmic distances without the need for intermediaries.

2. **Research Funding and Grants**: Scientific missions exploring distant stars, galaxies, or phenomena can be instantly funded. Organizations or individuals can transfer funds without worrying about transaction delays, allowing for uninterrupted research.

3. **Interplanetary Remittances**: As people migrate to colonies on other planets, they might need to send or receive money from their home planets. Traditional banking systems may not be feasible due to the enormous distances involved. Glyztera bridges this gap.

4. **Payment for Off-planet Services**: Future services like asteroid mining, interplanetary tourism, or even off-world entertainment might become prevalent. Payments for these services would require a cryptocurrency robust and swift enough to handle intergalactic distances, a role Glyztera is designed for.

5. **Universal Salary Systems**: For future jobs that span across planets or star systems, Glyztera can be used to implement a standardized, universal salary system ensuring everyone, no matter where they are, gets paid on time.

6. **Interstellar Crowdfunding**: Projects or endeavors that seek to benefit multiple planets or the whole of humanity can raise funds through Glyztera. Supporters from all across the galaxy can contribute seamlessly.

7. **Digital Preservation of Interplanetary Contracts**: Land agreements, research partnerships, or interplanetary treaties might need a secure, immutable ledger. Glyztera's blockchain can serve as a universal record keeper, providing transparency and trustworthiness to these essential documents.

In essence, as the universe becomes our playground, Glyztera promises to be the financial backbone, supporting a myriad of transactions, contracts, and commerce that the vastness of space will inevitably usher in.

## **Economic Parameters of Glyztera**

### **Initial Supply**

1. **Total Supply**: Glyztera will have a capped supply of 112 million coins, ensuring scarcity and long-term value.
2. **Pre-mined Supply**: We're committed to a fair launch and have opted for no pre-mined coins. Every Glyztera coin will be earned through mining activities.

### **Block Rewards**

1. **Exponential Decrease Mechanism**: Glyztera's block reward will decrease exponentially, ensuring that the last coin will be mined within an 8-year timeframe. This method not only rewards early miners but also aligns with our long-term vision for a sustainable and decentralized cryptocurrency.

2. **Forecasted Block Rewards**: A detailed chart will be provided that showcases the projected block rewards decrease over the 8-year period. Given the exponential decrease, early miners will benefit more, encouraging prompt adoption and network security.

### **Transaction Fees**

1. **Fee Distribution**: For every transaction on the Glyztera network, a certain percentage will be allocated as a fee. Out of this fee, 0.5% will be directly contributed to the Glyztera development fund. This ensures continuous funding for development, improvements, and community initiatives.
   
2. **Miner's Share**: The remaining transaction fee, after the 0.5% development allocation, will be awarded to miners, further incentivizing the network's security and sustainability.

### **Other Economic Parameters**

1. **Development Fund**: The 0.5% transaction fee allocation will accumulate in the Glyztera development fund. These funds will be transparently utilized for protocol improvements, community initiatives, and other essential developments to enhance Glyztera's ecosystem.
   
2. **Rewards for Full Nodes**: Details about full node rewards, if applicable, will be provided in future updates.

3. **Governance**: Any significant changes to economic parameters will be made transparently and will take into account community feedback. A robust governance mechanism will be outlined to ensure that Glyztera remains adaptable and responsive to the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

### **Economic Rationale**

1. **Sustainability**: By capping the supply and implementing an exponential decrease in block rewards, Glyztera aims to strike a balance between incentivizing early adoption and ensuring long-term network sustainability.
   
2. **Fairness**: With no pre-mining and a transparent block reward structure, we are ensuring that all participants, whether they are individual enthusiasts or large-scale miners, have an equal opportunity.
   
3. **Continuous Development**: The allocation of transaction fees to the development fund signifies our commitment to continuous improvement and adaptation to the needs of the Glyztera community.
